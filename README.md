# OperatingSystemsProjects
Projects created for my Operating Systems class

## What's Included:

The projects deal a lot with threads and culminated in the main project which was to alter the operating system of Minix3. 

The main project has it's own README detailing how to run it in the folder called 'minix3-stuff'.
